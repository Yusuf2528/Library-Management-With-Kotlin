# Library-Management-With-Kotlin
### Brief Description
- A library management system is a system that ensures the orderly preservation, organization and management of the large number of books owned by libraries; in other words, it is a system that facilitates the daily operation of libraries. Using this system, books can be found, reserved, borrowed or returned instantly. It also provides information about how many books are available, how many are reserved, how many are borrowed, or how much the overdue penalty will be if the delivery of the book is delayed. In order to keep track of all these functions, all that is needed is for the library administrators to keep a database of the books in process with the delivery dates. This helps to provide better service for the user.
